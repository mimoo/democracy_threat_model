# Democracy Threat Model

A threat model for democracies in general. Every democracy is different and so, some of these might only apply to some of these.
We should thrive to remain general, but give examples and resources to understand each point.
This document is made to understand how to defend against such threats, but also how a political system can be improved for the people.

## Insurance

What should a democracy provide? Every democracy is different, but perhaps a list is still in order:

* human rights
* cohesion of the society
* well-being of all of its people

## Attack Model

Who is targeted, by who, and to what end?

Targets:

* People
* Government
* Laws

Attackers:

* Government
* Internal threat (government)
* Minorities
* Majorities
* External threat (a different country)

Consequences:

* Coup d'etat
* Increase a minority's power (perhaps a political party)
* Increase a majority's power
* Death
* law change
* change of power (intra-national or inter-national), perhaps for trades between two countries.

## Attack Vectors

* Social Media
* Official Statements
* News Outlets
* Leaks
* Demonstrations, Events
* Terrorist Attacks
* Laws (sometimes passed during the night, or holidays)
